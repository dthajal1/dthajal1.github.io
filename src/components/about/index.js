					<Typography paragraph>
						I am a software engineer with a focus on full stack development. I
						graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in EECS and have hands-on
						experience with Next.js, TypeScript, Python, and React.js. I have
						built personal projects with them and also have used them
						extensively in my career thus far.
					</Typography>
					<Typography paragraph>
						Before beginning my career in software engineering, I went on to
						play professional soccer abroad. Through my soccer journey, I have
						learned that with right mindset, attitude, heart and grit, we can
						achieve anything. Now, the same drive and determination I used to
						excel in soccer, fuels my passion for technology.
					</Typography>
					<Typography paragraph>
						In my free time, I enjoy coaching soccer, exploring new tech trends,
						and building cool projects. Always eager to learn more and take on
						new challenges.
					</Typography>
					<Typography paragraph>
						Feel free to connect with me if youâ€™d like to chat about tech,
						soccer, or anything in between!
